            Utaran is a small, independently-run thrift store
            offering carefully selected second-hand clothing at affordable
            prices. We started this as students, and every item is handpicked
            and checked before listing.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-outside pl-5 space-y-3">
            <li>
              Items may show minor signs of previous wear (small fading, light
              pilling, etc.) unless described as "new" or "unused."
            </li>
            <li>
              Any significant flaws will be mentioned in the product description
              and shown in photos.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sizes may vary slightly from standard sizing since items come from
              different brands and eras — please check measurements in the
              product description if available.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We're a two-person team, so response times may occasionally be a
            little slower than a large store, but we personally read and respond
            to every message.
          </p>
